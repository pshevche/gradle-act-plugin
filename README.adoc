**Provides a convenient wrapper plugin over the https://github.com/nektos/act[act] project.**

The plugin defines an opinionated specification format for validating GitHub workflows locally using the https://github.com/nektos/act[act] runner.

Configured validation tasks execute specified GitHub workflows according to the provided specifications and report essential details in a user-friendly format.

[[getting_started]]
== Getting started

[[compatibility]]
=== Minimal supported versions

Minimal supported Gradle version: `7.4`

Minimal supported Java version: `11`

[[apply_plugin]]
=== Apply plugin

_build.gradle.kts_

[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("io.github.pshevche.act") version "1.0"
}
----

[[minimal_configuration]]
=== Minimal configuration

. Configure default validation task using the project extension.

    act {
        // define the root directory containing GitHub workflows to be validated
        workflowsRoot = file(".github/workflows")
        // define the root directory containing test scenarios and resources
        specsRoot = file(".github/act")
    }

. Add a GitHub workflow YAML file to your workflows root.

    name: Hello, World!
    on: [ push ]
    jobs:
        hello_world:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Print greeting
              run: echo "Hello, World!"

. Add a specification `*.act.yaml` file describing how to execute your workflow

    # display name of the workflow to be used in reports
    name: Smoke test "Hello World!" workflow
    # path to the workflow file relative to the configure workflows root
    workflow: hello_world.yaml

. Run built-in `./gradlew actTest` task to execute provided specifications
. View generated XML and HTML reports under `build/reports/act/actTest` directory.

[[custom_task]]
== Defining custom validations task

In addition to the default `actTest` task, custom validation tasks can be defined as follows:

_build.gradle.kts_

[source,kotlin]
----
import io.github.pshevche.act.ActTest

tasks.register<ActTest>("customActTest") {
    workflowsRoot = file(".github/customWorkflows")
    specsRoot = file(".github/customAct")
    forwardActOutput = true
    reportsDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir("customActTestReports")
}
----

[[reporting]]
== Reporting

In the configured reports directory, the task will generate two report files: `test.xml` and `test.html`:

* `test.xml`: a single XML file in an https://github.com/ota4j-team/open-test-reporting?tab=readme-ov-file#event-based-format[event-based Open Test Reporting format] containing results of all specifications.
* `test.html`: a human-readable HTML file containing results of all specifications.

[[limitations]]
== Known limitations

=== Sequential specification executions

Currently, `act` command has a state shared between invocations.
Invoking `act` in-parallel (e.g. to evaluate multiple specifications) may result in a polluted state and as a result flaky workflow executions.
To prevent this from happening, the default validation task has been designed to execute all specifications sequentially.
When adding a custom validation task, ensure that it does not run in-parallel with other `ActTest` tasks to prevent the polluted state.

=== Supported `act` options

`act` provides a large number of options to configure workflow execution.
This plugin aims to abstract away the configuration effort and enforce best practices.
Therefore, the initial release of the plugin has a built-in support for a small set of options deemed essential to design meaningful test scenarios for GitHub workflows.
Additional unsupported arguments can be passed using the `additionalArgs` property of a specification file.
Despite having this option, feel free to submit a feature request for a new option describing how the plugin and its users will contribute from having a native support for this property.
